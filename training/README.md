# Training tracks

Everyone starts with different interests and different skillsets. We strongly believe that programming and computing skills are one of the most valuable skills you can have in the 21st century given the pervasiveness of software in every facet of life. However, the harsh reality is that some people don't have the time to upskill in this area. Hence we have two training tracks: user and developer. The user training track will teach you the basic minimum you need to understand, buy and store Bitcoin. It will not give you the insight into the true potential of Bitcoin and ability to interact with the software and the Bitcoin network to the extent that is possible. Hence if you have the time please consider the developer training track either once you've completed the user track or if you already know the basics of Bitcoin start with the developer track. In the world of bits as Douglas Rushkoff [said](https://www.amazon.com/Program-Be-Programmed-Commands-Digital/dp/159376426X) it is program or be programmed. At the bare minimum you should understand that programmers can get you to do things without you realizing.
