# Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a free and open source package manager for MacOS. It can also be used on Linux but it is most widely used on MacOS. Once installed you can use the `brew` command to install packages that aren’t installed by default. (Homebrew is run by unpaid volunteers and you can donate to the project [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew#donations).)

To install Homebrew paste this command into the Terminal and then press Enter:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)” 
```

It can also be accessed [here](https://brew.sh/).

This will take a while to install so get a coffee or revise your Terminal commands or Vim commands while you wait!

When it is installed you should see a `Installation successful!` message. The command `brew help` will give you guidance on some of the other brew commands. For example `brew --version` will tell you the version of brew that you have installed.
