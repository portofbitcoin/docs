# PGP

Keys, keys, keys. Bitcoin private keys (the most important to store securely), SSH keys and now PGP keys. Why so many keys and what now are PGP keys? What’s the difference between PGP keys and GPG keys? Are they the same? So many questions….

PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy and is used for signing, encrypting and decrypting messages. It was developed by Phil Zimmerman in 1991. GPG stands for Gnu Privacy Guard and is a re-implementation of PGP. Both GPG and PGP are implementations of the same standard and so you can (kinda) use these acronyms interchangeably.

You can download and install GPGTools for MacOS [here](https://gpgtools.org/).

Then in the command line you can generate a new GPP keypair using the command:

`gpg --gen-key`

Your keys will be stored in `~/.gnupg`.

You can list your secret keys using this command:

`gpg --list-secret-keys`

You can list all your keys using this command:

`gpg --list-keys`

And for general help:

`gpg --help`

You can upload your PGP keys to openpgp [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/upload).
