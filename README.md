# Welcome to the Port of Bitcoin!

Welcome to the Port of Bitcoin. It is a confusing and bewildering world out there. But if you block out the noise: the clowns, the fraudsters, the hucksters selling everything from Bitcoin clones to jpegs there is simplicity and wizardry to be found at the heart of Bitcoin.

There are various ancillary services available at the Port of Bitcoin when you are ready for them. But before you consider parting with your hard earned satoshis there is work to do. Open up your laptop and take the first steps to becoming an empowered sovereign individual. At the Port of Bitcoin we donâ€™t want to prey on the uninformed, we want to partner with the Bitcoin whales of tomorrow. We hope that when you leave the Port of Bitcoin you look back fondly at what you learnt and the services provided and can't wait to return.
