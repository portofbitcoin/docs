# Welcome to the Port of Bitcoin!

Welcome to the Port of Bitcoin. It is a confusing and bewildering world out there. But if you block out the noise: the clowns, the fraudsters, the hucksters selling everything from Bitcoin clones to jpegs there is simplicity and wizardry to be found at the heart of Bitcoin.

There are various ancillary services available at the Port of Bitcoin when you are ready for them. But before you consider parting with your hard earned satoshis there is work to do. Open up your laptop and take the first steps to becoming an empowered sovereign individual. At the Port of Bitcoin we donâ€™t want to prey on the uninformed, we want to partner with the Bitcoin whales of tomorrow. We hope that when you leave the Port of Bitcoin you look back fondly at what you learnt and the services provided and can't wait to return.

## Technology choices

At the Port of Bitcoin we believe in simplicity. At every point of your Bitcoin journey there will be a multitude of options when it comes to which technology to use. We could outline all the options and the trade-offs for each one but this can cause indecision and slow progress. So instead we make some choices at the outset.

MacOS - We will focus on MacOS because we believe our target audience will predominantly be on MacOS. Linux would be our preference as it is open source and arguably the most influential project on Bitcoin today. Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux is a titan of software history that Bitcoin owes a huge debt to. But if you are already on Linux you probably don't need the early stage guidance that we are starting with here. By choosing MacOS you can get started straight away without installing a
new operating system and deciding which Linux distribution to use.

Terminal - Terminal is installed by default on a Mac. iTerm would be our preference as it has some features that Terminal doesn't have but given iTerm needs to be installed we will stick with Terminal.

Vim - Vim is a free and open source text editor. The most obvious candidates were Vim and Emacs. There are arguments for both but in the interests of simplicity we needed to make a choice. 

Git - Git is a free and open source version control system. Linus Torvalds (remember him?) created it and today it is the most widely used version control system on which websites like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc rely.

GitHub - We don't like choosing company products that aren't open source. But like we did with MacOS (Apple closed source software) we decided on GitHub (Microsoft closed source software) because it is the most widely used. We hope at a later date that you consider some of the alternatives but for now we believe you are best placed with GitHub.

Bitcoin Core - The reference Bitcoin implementation and dominant full node software on the Bitcoin network today. This is one of the easier choices. It is written in C++ (a more advanced language) but there are tests written in Python (see later).

Core Lightning - There are a number of high quality open source Lightning implementations so this is one of the more difficult choices. However, given that Core Lightning is arguably the most Unix like of the Lightning implementations and it is co-maintained by another long time Linux contributor (Rusty Russell) you can't really go wrong with Core Lightning. It is written in C (another advanced language) but similarly with Bitcoin Core there are tests written in Python. 

Python - There are too many programming languages to discuss but we believe Python is the best language for new programmers and many of the tests for Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning are written in Python.

We want to be clear that if you disagree with any of these choices we hope you can switch in your preferred choice and still get value from the rest of the resources. As much as we could we've tried to allocate tooling that is free and open source. MacOS and GitHub are the exceptions to this but we hope you understand the perspectives given above. Certainly if you ever get to Linus Torvalds or Rusty Russell levels of wizardry you won't be relying on any closed source software
but it takes many years of dedication (and a touch of genius) to get to that level.
